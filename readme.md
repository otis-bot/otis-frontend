#Otis-Bot Front-End

Otis-Bot Front-End is an Otis project, built and maintained by students and graduates of the Firehose Project. Otis-Bot Front-End is a ES6, React, Redux, and Webpack project.

The purpose of the front-end is to display the scraped Slack URLs for potentially informative and helpful information posted by the participants of the community. When the bot 'hears' a URL posted (based on a regular expression test), it attempts to POST to an API server that is charged with storing and maintaining the URLs and then pulled into the Front-End Application.
